# Exercises.Day7

Exercises and solutions for the seventh day.

## 30. A plotting tool

Use the plotting class from exercise 15 to create a tool that will parse simple math expressions, evaluate them in a given interval and plot the results.

Create a user control that let's you re-use all the work done before. The user control will depend on your plotting class and should perform the drawing of the plot. The parsing should be done in another class that just expects a string to be given.

## 31. Your first dynamic webpage

Create a webpage with ASP.NET MVC 4. The `HomeController` should display a welcome page with an input box and a submit button on the `Index()` action. Once a user presses the submit button a page should be shown which displays the content of the input box.

## 32. A simple Windows Store app

Recreate your reaction time game as a Windows Store app. You can reuse your logic (maybe you can now improve it), but you will have to re-implement the UI. Use the designer for doing the redesigning.
